# java-projects

A command line interface(CLI) calculator application built using java.
# Simple Java Console Calculator

This project serves as a practical implementation of basic Java programming concepts, including user input processing and conditional logic.

## Features
- Basic Arithmetic: Supports Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- Input Validation: Includes checks to prevent errors such as division by zero.
- Precision: Outputs results formatted to two decimal places for clarity.

## Code Structure
- Scanner Class: Utilized for capturing user input from the console.
- Switch Expressions: Implemented to efficiently handle operator selection.
- Error Handling: Logic included to manage mathematical impossibilities and invalid operators.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
- A terminal or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code.

## Installation and Execution
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/java-calculator.git](https://github.com/your-username/java-calculator.git)
